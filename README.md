        <p>Hi there! My name is Minji Lee. I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in Technology at Purdue University. As a deep learning engineer, I excel in the areas of computer vision, especially semantic segmentation of farming and agriculture images, performance modeling, and source code algorithm optimization. My research aims to bridge the gap between theoretical segmentation models and their practical applications through innovative design and implementation. Currently, I am working as a researcher to utilize SAM (Segment Anything Model) developed by Meta, evaluating its validity as a foundation model in comparison to traditional models such as CNNs. This evaluation aims to validate the hypothesis that SAM is also effective in specific domains. To enhance my UAV-captured dataset, I have generated synthetic images of eastern red cedar trees using diffusion models, which are integrated into the evaluation process to benchmark model performance. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:lee3450@purdue.edu" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">lee3450@purdue.edu</a> if you have any questions or would like to connect.</p>

## <a id="About Me"></a>About Me

As my name suggests, I am originally from Seoul, South Korea, and I lived in Japan for a while. As a senior undergraduate student in 2016, I had the privilege of visiting Purdue University as part of a visiting scholar group. The experience left a lasting impression, and I was thrilled to return to Purdue after receiving an offer, largely due to the outstanding teamwork.

My master's thesis focused on designing a zipper robot integrated with a machine learning algorithm to determine the optimal threshold using sensor data collected from people with physical disabilities. The algorithm leveraged the data to enhance the robot's performance and adaptability, providing a more efficient and user-friendly experience for individuals with varying levels of physical ability.

## Selected Projects

### Semantic Segmentation
In addition to my work in integrating AI and ML in agriculture and forestry, I have a keen interest in the analysis of geographical and meteorological data. This field offers rich opportunities for leveraging machine learning techniques to gain insights into various environmental phenomena and make informed decisions.

#### Research Focus

My research in this area centers around leveraging advanced machine learning models and techniques to analyze large-scale geographical and meteorological datasets. By applying data analysis methods to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in weather and environmental data, I aim to contribute to our understanding of complex Earth systems and support decision-making processes in areas such as climate adaptation, disaster preparedness, and resource management.

### Current Projects

- **Geospatial Analysis of Climate Data:** I am currently involved in a project that focuses on analyzing climate data collected from various geographical locations. By applying machine learning algorithms to this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological variables over time.

- **Predictive Modeling for Extreme Weather Events:** Another project I am working on involves developing predictive models for extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. By combining historical weather data with machine learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of forecasting and enhance preparedness and response efforts.
